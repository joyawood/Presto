Presto is a hybrid life-logging and scheduling app that allows its users to plan, priotize and reflect on their lives. The app comprises of three tabs: the Daily Log to prioritize task, items and events; the Future Log to record less-immediate events; and the Habit Tracker tab to record days in which a habit was or wasn't fulfilled. Presto is for iOS-users who are managing many events and tasks in their lives and want to both organize and reflect. Features like the Habit Tracker may be especially useful to people attempting lifestyle changes while the Daily Log may be more useful for students or professionals who manage many daily tasks.

Bugs: Local task notifications are not implemented in their full functionality. Users only recieve notifications when Presto is running in the background (they are not on the app). Also, if the user changes the title of their task, they will recieve two notifications. However, notifications successfuly edit when the time is changed and are canceled when the task is deleted.
